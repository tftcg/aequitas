        What are Bounty abilities?
        <span><a href="#__1"><img src="/images/permalink.svg"/></a></span>
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        There are two parts to a Bounty ability: a trigger condition that tells you to “use this card’s Bounty ability” and the Bounty ability itself that gives you a reward. In this set, all the conditions are the same: when the character does enough attack damage to KO an enemy. The rewards are different on each card.

        If a character does more than enough attack damage to KO an enemy, does that count?
        <span><a href="#__2"><img src="/images/permalink.svg"/></a></span>
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        Yes. The character can do more attack damage than is necessary to KO the enemy and you’ll still get the reward.

        <span><a href="#__3"><img src="/images/permalink.svg"/></a></span>

        Safeguard is a new keyword ability that limits how much damage can be done to a character that’s undamaged.

        <span><a href="#__4"><img src="/images/permalink.svg"/></a></span>

        <span><a href="#__5"><img src="/images/permalink.svg"/></a></span>
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        No. Moving damage counters doesn’t count as damaging the character, although after the damage counter is moved, the character will be damaged and Safeguard will no longer work. Sneaky!

      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        Yes. Safeguard works as long as the character is currently undamaged, even if it was previously damaged in the game. If you repair that damage, Safeguard can cushion another blow.

      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        A Revenge ability is a triggered ability that triggers when the character with the ability is KO’d. There aren’t that many of them. They’re a Decepticon thing. The Decepticons must be up to something.

        <span><a href="#__8"><img src="/images/permalink.svg"/></a></span>
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        Battle Masters and Weaponizers are characters that start in bot mode and can be played in their Upgrade mode after they are KO’d. They don’t have alt modes and can’t flip while they are on the battlefield.<br/>In Siege 2 (Wave 4), there are two Weaponizers, each made up of two cards. They start assembled together in bot mode. When one of these Weaponizers is KO’d, it splits into two different Upgrades that you can then play. These Upgrades can be played on separate characters or onto the same character.<br/>After a Battle Master or Weaponizer Upgrade would leave the battlefield, it’s put into your KO area instead.

      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        Those cards are essentially out of the game, except if something specifically puts them somewhere else. They aren’t scrapped, so they won’t be reshuffled into your deck when your deck is empty.

        I noticed that Omega Supreme (Base) doesn’t have an ability to combine into Captain Omega Supreme. What happens if both the Spaceship and Tank are KO’d before I get the chance to combine?
        <span><a href="#__10"><img src="/images/permalink.svg"/></a></span>
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        The combine abilities don’t work from the KO area, so in that case your Base would be left standing alone. Unless you have a way to bring the Spaceship or the Tank back onto the battlefield, you won’t be able to combine them into Captain Omega Supreme. Good luck!

        What happens if my last two characters are those two and they’re both KO’d at the same time. Dpo their Revenge abilities work and keep me in the game?
        <span><a href="#__12"><img src="/images/permalink.svg"/></a></span>
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        Unfortunately, no. Once your last character is KO’d, you lose the game. Fortunately, having them both KO’d at the same time is pretty unusual.

        Both Revenge abilities put cards from my hand under Raider Skytread. What does this mean?
        <span><a href="#__13"><img src="/images/permalink.svg"/></a></span>
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        The cards under Raider Skytread are basically out of play for a while. They’re not considered on the battlefield, even if that’s where they are physically, so none of their abilities apply. If one of those cards is an Upgrade, that Upgrade isn’t on Raider Skytread, and so on. They’re also not in your scrap pile, so they won’t be shuffled into your deck when it’s empty. They can return to your hand using Raider Skytread’s last ability.

        Each of Captain Astrotrain’s abilities triggers if he has a certain number of Upgrades. What happens if the ability triggers, but then his Upgrades are scrapped during the attack?
        <span><a href="#__14"><img src="/images/permalink.svg"/></a></span>

      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        In that case you’ll reveal as many cards as you can from your deck, then—leaving those cards aside—shuffle your scrap pile to rebuild your deck. Then reveal more cards so a total of 5 are revealed. The revealed cards that aren’t Upgrades will be only cards in your scrap pile when you’re done.

        The cards under Lockdown are basically out of play for a while. They’re not considered on the battlefield, even if that’s where they are physically, so none of their abilities apply. If one of those cards is an Upgrade, that Upgrade isn’t on Lockdown, and so on. They’re also not in your scrap pile, so they won’t be shuffled into your deck when it’s empty.

      <div class="answer">
        In that case, your opponent scraps all the cards in their deck. Then, setting those cards aside, they shuffle all the other cards in their scrap pile into their deck. Then they scrap enough cards from their reformed deck to scrap the total number of cards they were supposed to. In most cases, however many cards they were supposed to scrap will be the number of cards in their scrap pile after Megatron’s ability is finished. Sorry, after Lord Megatron’s ability is finished.

        <span><a href="#__31"><img src="/images/permalink.svg"/></a></span>
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        That ability doesn’t directly modify how much attack damage is being done to the character (note it doesn’t use “instead”), so it waits for effects like Blast Suit to apply, then sees if the character is taking more than 5 attack damage. If it is, the character takes 5 attack damage.

        Sergeant Barricade’s ability puts a flipped card under himself instead of into your scrap pile. What does it mean when a card is under Sergeant Barricade?

      <div class="answer">
        The card under Sergeant Barricade is basically out of play for a bit (at least, until you play it using the alt ode ability). While the card is under Sergeant Barricade, it’s not considered on the battlefield, even if that’s where it is physically, so none of its abilities apply. If the card is an Upgrade, that Upgrade isn’t on Sergeant Barricade, and so on. It’s also not in your scrap pile, so it won’t be shuffled into your deck when it’s empty.

        Changing a character’s base attack is just like changing the number that’s printed on the card. From there, all other bonuses apply as normal. For example, if you have a Truck with 3 attack upgraded with Indestructible Sword (that gives it +2 attack), its attack will be 9 (7 from 4-Wheel Drive +2 from the upgrade). If it stops being a Truck that turn, its attack will be 5 (base 3 attack +2 from the upgrade).

        If there are multiple abilities trying to modify how much attack damage the upgraded character would take, the controller of that character decides what order to apply them in. In this example, you could choose either of the following:<br/>    Reveal Heroic Resolve first. Instead of taking 3 attack damage, your character is now taking 1 attack damage (enough to drop it to 1 health). Now Blast Suit applies, and the 1 attack damage becomes 0 attack damage, which is half of 1 rounded down. Your character ends up taking no attack damage and Blast Suit is scrapped.<br/>    Apply Blast Suit first. Instead of taking 3 attack damage, your character now is taking 1 attack damage, which is half of 3 rounded down. This isn’t enough attack damage to KO your character, so Heroic Resolve stays face down.

        Let’s say my opponent plays Pep Talk, an Action that says “Draw 2 cards.” What happens?
        <span><a href="#__63"><img src="/images/permalink.svg"/></a></span>
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        Assuming they drew a card at the start of their turn, you would reveal Hijack. Then instead them drawing two cards, you’d draw two cards. Hijack’s effect lasts for the rest of the turn, so if they tried to draw more cards, you’d draw them again.

        Lucky Vest doesn’t directly modify how much attack damage is being done to the character (note it doesn’t use “instead”), so it waits for effects like Blast Suit to apply, then sees if the character is taking more than 4 attack damage. If it is, the character takes 4 attack damage.
