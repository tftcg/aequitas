        What does "being upgraded" mean on Gears’s stratagem Sabotage?
        <span><a href="#__2"><img src="/images/permalink.svg"/></a></span>
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        Being upgraded covers any time an upgrade is Put on a character (including Playing, Moving, and Swapping). It does not cover when an upgrade remains on a character during combining.

        What happens if I Reprocess to Scrap an Increased Durability on a character with 3 health remaining?
        <span><a href="#__3"><img src="/images/permalink.svg"/></a></span>
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        The Increased Durability is scrapped and the character is then KO'd. As the character is now in the KO area, the repair does not happen.

        Start Your Engines says "Flip each of your characters from bot mode to Car mode". Does this mean that you can target "Car mode" with Precision Fire? Is Car a mode?
        <span><a href="#__4"><img src="/images/permalink.svg"/></a></span>
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        No. Car is a trait and not a mode. Despite this card using 'Car mode', you should consider it as a short hand for 'a mode with the Car trait'. The same is true for Hunker Down's use of Tank mode, and Pop a Wheelie's use of Motorcycle mode.

        For the purposes of Windsweeper's alt-mode ability, is Blitzwing a Plane on your starting team?
        <span><a href="#__5"><img src="/images/permalink.svg"/></a></span>
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        No. Your starting team are the visible cards you present to your opponent at the beginning of the game to show you have an acceptable numbers of stars. These are the sides of the cards that show the star costs of the cards. 

                Given this, Blitzwing is a Tank on your starting team unless you are playing the Master Converter stratagem, in which case Blitzwing is both a Tank and Plane on your starting team.

        Can Wolfwire pick up a Paralyzo Box?
        <span><a href="#__6"><img src="/images/permalink.svg"/></a></span>
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        Yes. In bot-mode, Wolfwire's ability indicates that instead of the game concept of swapping a green battle icon, Wolfwire can put one in hand. While Wolfwire, with a Melee trait, is unable to swap a card for Paralyzo Box due to its Ranged hybrid green battle icon, it is still a green battle icon and qualifies for his ability.

        <a name="__7"/>
        If I have 1 damage remaining before a character is KO'd, will Lucky Dodge always work because it can only take 1 damage?
        <span><a href="#__7"><img src="/images/permalink.svg"/></a></span>
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        No. A character takes whatever attack damage is applied to it, regardless of how much damage remains to KO the character. Lucky Dodge works on the attack damage being applied to the character, not the actual damage needed to KO them.

        Can Sky Shadow Sync be used in a deck that already includes Ominus, allowing you to potentially have two Ominus card's on the battlefield at the same time?
        <span><a href="#__8"><img src="/images/permalink.svg"/></a></span>
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        Yes. Character cards from Outside the Game are outside of the rule disallowing duplicate characters from being used.

    <dt>Tidal Wave - Dark Fleet (Aircraft Carrier)</li>
    <dd>
    <ul class="card_faq">
  
    <li id="Aequitas Rules Roundup 2020-08__9" class="faq_entry">
      <div class="question">
        <a name="__9"/>
        Do Tidal Wave’s deployable 4-stars need to be included in a deck list, or can they be switched out between games independently of the sideboard?
        <span><a href="#__9"><img src="/images/permalink.svg"/></a></span>
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        The deployable 4-star characters do not need to be listed in a deck list, allowing different characters to be used in different games. The correct play is for each player to present their starting team to each other, and then the Tidal Wave player fetches their 4-star character, or characters, shows them to their opponent to confirm they are 4 stars or fewer, and places them under the relevant Tidal Wave cards.
