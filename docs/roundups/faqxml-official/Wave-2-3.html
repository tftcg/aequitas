        What are Combiners?
        <span><a href="#__1"><img src="/images/permalink.svg"/></a></span>
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        It would be hard to have a set called Rise of the Combiners without… the Combiners!<br/>Combiners are teams of characters that join in a third mode called Combiner mode. Most teams have a corresponding battle card called an Enigma that combines the team under the right circumstances. One Combiner in this set (Dreadwing - Sky Destroyer) has a different way of combining.<br/>When a character is combined, it starts untapped and it gets all the damage counters from the characters that formed it. It can keep upgrades from those characters based on its upgrade slots. Unless the Combiner says differently, it will have 1 Weapon slot, 1 Utility slot, and 1 Armor slot like most characters. If there are too many Upgrades to fit into a slot, you can keep as many as you can fit, and the rest are scrapped.<br/>A character in Combiner mode is a single character, even though it’s made up of multiple cards.  When it attacks, the whole thing becomes tapped. If it’s KO’d (and somehow you haven’t lost the game), it stays in Combiner mode in the KO area.<br/>A character in Combiner mode can’t flip. Ignore any instruction to flip it. Also, a character in Combiner mode can’t “break apart” into its individual cards.

        If I use an Enigma to combine my characters into the Combiner, can I then use the card’s first<br/>ability to get its effect?
        <span><a href="#__2"><img src="/images/permalink.svg"/></a></span>
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        No. You always follow the instructions on the card in order. If you don’t already have the specified Combiner on the battlefield, the first ability won’t do anything.

      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        Triple Changers are characters with three modes: bot mode and two alt modes (labeled 1 and<br/>2). They start in alt mode 1. When a Triple Changer flips, it can flip to either of the two other<br/>modes.

      <div class="answer">
        If it’s in bot mode, you can flip it to alt mode 1 or alt mode 2. If it’s in one of its alt modes,<br/>you can either not flip it or flip it to the other alt mode.

      <div class="answer">
        This set introduces a new battle icon: green! Here’s how it works. After a battle in which you<br/>flipped at least one card with a green battle icon, you may swap a card in your hand with one of<br/>the cards you flipped with a green battle icon. The card you swap from your hand will be<br/>scrapped at the end of the turn, along with all the other cards you played or flipped during the<br/>turn.

        <span><a href="#__8"><img src="/images/permalink.svg"/></a></span>

        Brave is a new keyword ability that helps some characters protect the rest of their team. When<br/>choosing which enemy to attack, you must choose one with brave if possible.

      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        No, and in fact you can’t even if you want to. Brave doesn’t override the rules for attacking<br/>tapped/untapped characters. If your opponent has any tapped characters you must attack one<br/>of them. If a tapped character had brave, you would have to attack that one if you could.

      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        Stealth is a new keyword ability that lets some characters strike from the shadows without fear<br/>of reprisal. When choosing which enemy to attack, you must attack a character without stealth<br/>if able.

        <span><a href="#__12"><img src="/images/permalink.svg"/></a></span>
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        Stealth doesn’t override the rules for attacking tapped/untapped characters. Since the<br/>tapped character is the only one that can be attacked, that’s where your attack is headed.

      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        Brave and stealth essentially cancel each other out. You must attack that character if able,<br/>and you must attack other characters if able. This basically means you must attack a character<br/>you can attack, the same as if those abilities weren’t there.

      <div class="answer">
        Plan is a new keyword that helps set up devastating battles. When instructed to plan, you may<br/>put up to the specified number of cards from your hand back on top of your deck. If you put<br/>more than one card on top of your deck this way, you can put them there in any order.

        In cases like that, the player whose character it is can choose which effect to apply. Then see if the other effect(s) still apply. Keep applying these effects until none apply. Each effect can apply to the same damage only once.

        Sure. Let’s say your opponent has a character with 12 health and 9 damage counters on it.  You attack with the chosen character and would do 6 damage to it.

      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        Battle Masters are characters that start in bot mode and can be played in their upgrade mode<br/>after they are KO’d. Battle Masters don’t have an alt mode and can’t flip while they are on the<br/>battlefield. There are both Autobot and Decepticon Battle Masters.

      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        The size of the card doesn’t change how they play. While in bot mode, Battle Masters are<br/>just like other characters. They can attack and be attacked, they can be damaged, they can be<br/>upgraded, and so on.

      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        No. If you played an upgrade earlier in the turn, you can still play the Battle Master in its<br/>upgrade mode after it’s KO’d in bot mode.<br/>In some unusual situations, your Battle Master in bot mode is KO’d during your turn before you<br/>attack. Playing the upgrade mode in those situations doesn’t stop you from then playing an<br/>upgrade from your hand before you attack.

        If that happens, the card is put into your KO area with its upgrade mode face up. This can<br/>happen if the upgrade would be returned to your hand, returned to your deck, directly<br/>scrapped, or if the character that had it is KO’d.

      <div class="answer">
        You can use one tap ability during your turn, before you attack. It’s one of your turn actions,<br/>just like playing an Action card, playing an Upgrade card, or flipping one of your characters to its<br/>other mode. To use the tap ability, the character that has the ability must be untapped. Using<br/>the ability causes the character to become tapped.

        <span><a href="#__122"><img src="/images/permalink.svg"/></a></span>
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        Secret Actions are a new kind of Action card, keeping your opponent in the dark until it’s too<br/>late for them to stop you. To play a Secret Action, put it into the played area (where actions and<br/>flipped battle cards normally go) face down. Secret Actions don’t have an immediate effect, but<br/>wait until later in the game to do their thing, often on your opponent’s turn!<br/>Each Secret Action has two parts. First, a Reveal condition. This tells you when to reveal the<br/>Secret Action by turning it face up. Most Reveal conditions are things your opponent does, like<br/>attack one of your characters or play certain kinds of cards.<br/>Second, a When Revealed effect. This tells you what the Secret Action does when it’s finally<br/>revealed. After a Secret Action is revealed this way, it stays in the played area and will be<br/>scrapped at the end of the turn.<br/>One warning though: Secret Actions won’t wait around forever. If a Secret Action is played<br/>during your turn, it will wait until the end of your opponent’s next turn. If its Reveal condition<br/>isn’t met by then, it will be scrapped along with all the other played or flipped cards from that<br/>turn. It’s scrapped face up, and scrapping it this way won’t cause its When Revealed effect to<br/>happen.

        If the Autobot I tap has any upgrades that increase its attack, do those bonuses count?
        <span><a href="#__184"><img src="/images/permalink.svg"/></a></span>
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        Yes. A character’s attack total equals its printed attack value plus any bonuses it’s getting from any other card.

        No. Hiding Spot isn’t revealed until after your opponent locks in their choice for attacker.

        Infiltrate won’t be revealed because of a Secret Action, even if that Secret Action has orange battle icons. This is also true when the Secret Action is later revealed. It was already played face down, so Infiltrate won’t notice it. Sneaky!

        When determining if the character has 7 stars or fewer, does it matter which mode it’s in?

        No. A character always has the number of stars printed on it, no matter which mode it’s in.

        If the upgraded character defends against an enemy that has pierce 1, what happens?

        If a character’s pierce total is 0 or lower, treat that character as if it didn’t have pierce when determining how much damage is done. Pierce -1 doesn’t do anything weird.

        The extra cards are simply not flipped. It doesn’t matter whether those extra flips were because of abilities like bold, a white battle icon, or any other ability.
