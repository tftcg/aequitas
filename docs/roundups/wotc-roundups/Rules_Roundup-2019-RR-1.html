        If Optimus Prime - Battlefield Legend attacks in Bot Mode and you flip a New Designs, can it be used to put an upgrade on to one of my characters? Also is this the same if I flip a Brainstorm?

        Force Field states "if the upgraded character would take 5 or more attack damage - instead scrap this card and the upgraded character takes 4 attack damage." What happens when the target received 4 or fewer attack damage? Do they take that damage and keep Force Field equipped until 5 attack damage is received or does it still get scrapped even if you have only taken 3 attack damage?

        Force Field will not be scrapped if you take 4 or fewer attack damage on one attack, and it does not remember previous attacks, even in the same turn.

        What happens if I have Megatron - Living Weapon equipped with 2 weapons and an armor and I play Swap Parts?

      <div class="answer">
        In this scenario, if the other character you are choosing with Swap Parts does not have an ability or effect that allows them to hold multiple weapons, you will be able to bring the armor and a weapon of your choice to them. The remaining weapon will stay on Megatron.

        If I am playing Autobot Mirage in his Bot Mode and I hit three white pips while attacking, he untaps. Does this mean I get an additional attack this turn or is he just untapped for next turn? The only reason I ask is because his effect states "during his first attack" so I felt it implied he could attack more than once that turn.

      <div class="answer">
        Ordinarily, he would only get one attack and then untap. However, if your opponent is completely tapped out, Mirage and any of your other untapped characters will get an additional attack.
