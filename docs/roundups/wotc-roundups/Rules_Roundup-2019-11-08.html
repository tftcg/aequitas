        Optimus Prime - Battlefield Legend flips completely for his attack & chooses Leap of Faith as his Action. The first card Leap of Faith reveals is Grenade Launcher. If I attach it to Optimus Prime Battlefield Legend, does he immediately get the +4 Attack boost?

      <p class="question">
        Optimus Prime - Battlefield Legend is equipped with Power Punch, flips completely for his attack, and chooses Leap of Faith as his Action. The first card Leap of Faith reveals is W-5 Gyro Blaster. If OPBL attaches this, do I keep all the flips revealed from Power Punch? If so, does that mean my opponent now cannot flip more than 2 cards for their defense now that W-5 Gyro Blaster has been attached?
        <span><a href="#Rules_Roundup-2019-11-08__9-2"><img src="/images/permalink.svg"/></a></span>
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        No, W-5 Gyro Blaster’s ability only triggers if it’s attached when the character attacks or defends.

      <p class="question">
        If I have a character with Bumpers attached, and I play Involuntary Promotion on a car in my KO area, does the returned character receive the Bumpers in time to prevent the damage counters from being moved?
        <span><a href="#Rules_Roundup-2019-11-08__9-3"><img src="/images/permalink.svg"/></a></span>
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        The damage and upgrades are moved at the same time. Bumpers’ effect won’t stop the damage counters from being moved.

      <p class="question">
        Regarding Pincer, will it allow the follow-up attack to bypass normal rule processes? For example, I attack with Razorclaw in Bot Mode against an untapped unit. Can my other Decepticon attack this untapped unit? What about bypassing Brave?
        <span><a href="#Rules_Roundup-2019-11-08__9-4"><img src="/images/permalink.svg"/></a></span>
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        If you can’t legally choose another Decepticon as the attacker, and the same character as the defender, you don’t get the extra attack. In other words, you can’t just ignore Brave or other rules.

        <span><a href="#Rules_Roundup-2019-11-08__9-5"><img src="/images/permalink.svg"/></a></span>
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        Yes. If you have no characters in KO or the characters in your KO area have too many stars, you can use Involuntary Promotion to KO one of your characters.

      <p class="question">
        Regarding Involuntary Promotion trigger timings, when I shift the upgrade and damage counters to the returned character. Do I get to choose to shift the damage counters first followed by the upgrades since they are both my triggers?
        <span><a href="#Rules_Roundup-2019-11-08__9-6"><img src="/images/permalink.svg"/></a></span>
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        No part of Involuntary Promotion is a triggered ability. The instructions are all followed in order and the damage counters and upgrades are moved at the same time.

        If I equip Crash Landing on an Air Strike Patrol bot that is buffed by Tailwind's +2 Attack, does it trigger Crash Landing with the extra Attack?
        <span><a href="#Rules_Roundup-2019-11-08__9-7"><img src="/images/permalink.svg"/></a></span>
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        Crash Landing will do damage based on whatever the plane’s attack was when it was last on the battlefield. Bonuses like Tailwind’s will still apply because the plane is KO’d during the battle.

        Nightbird stealing cards from an opponent's scrap pile: Can I keep them after playing them?
        <span><a href="#Rules_Roundup-2019-11-08__9-8"><img src="/images/permalink.svg"/></a></span>
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        No. Any action you play from your opponent’s scrap pile goes into your played area, and eventually back to their scrap pile. (Cards always go to their owner’s hand, deck, KO area, and scrap pile).

        Revenge on Ratbat and Bounty on Deadlock both trigger upon Ratbat's KO, but which triggers first?
        <span><a href="#Rules_Roundup-2019-11-08__9-9"><img src="/images/permalink.svg"/></a></span>
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        Bounty abilities and Revenge abilities will usually trigger at the same time. Bounty abilities are usually handled first because they belong to the active player.

      <p class="question">
        How does Pincer Movement work?  If I have three untapped Decepticons and play Pincer Movement, do I get to attack the same enemy with each of my Decepticons in sequence, or do I only get one extra attack total.  If I can get multiple attacks this way, and I untap one of the previously attacking Decepticons (such as via Anticipation Engine revealing Ready for Action), can that Decepticon attack again?
        <span><a href="#Rules_Roundup-2019-11-08__9-11"><img src="/images/permalink.svg"/></a></span>
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        Pincer Movement gives you only one additional attack. After you play it, the next time one of your Decepticons attacks an enemy this turn, you’ll get the extra attack after the current attack.

      <p class="question">
        So, let's say we have Omega Supreme (Base), (Spaceship), and (Tank) verses Kickback, Shrapnel, Barrage and Ransack. No side has any KO bots.  All bots on Omega's team is tapped. Shrapnel and Barrage are tapped.  It's the Insecticons turn with Kickback and Ransack untapped and ready to attack. They have 4 battlecards in their deck. They send Kickback to attack Omega Supreme (Tank). Kickback needs to flip at least 8 Battlecards, so 4 Battlecards are first flipped, causing their deck to be reshuffled.  Captain Omega Supreme then formed. Kickback continues his same attack now onto Captain Omega Supreme, flipping at least 4 more battlecards. The player with Omega NOW gets to flip for defending. Since Captain Omega Supreme is now untapped, Ransack is no longer able to attack, thus ending the turn of the Insecticons.<br/>My question is, is the sequence of events that I have listed correct, or did I miss something?

        When you use Sabotaged Armaments, and your opponent has a Power Punch on the attacker, do they get the Bold before Sabotaged Armaments activates?

      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        No. This all happens before Battle Cards are flipped.<br/>Speaking of which, what happens when a character upgraded with Anticipation Engine swings into a Sabotaged Armaments?<br/>Anticipation Engine and Sabotaged Armaments will both trigger at the same time. The attacker will resolve Anticipation Engine first, then the defender will resolve Sabotaged Armaments.

        Does Involuntary Promotion count as "repairing" the resurrected character? In other words, could Torox or Ratchet benefit from its play?

      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        Your character sideboard is allowed 1 character with 19 stars or fewer. Trypticon is too big for this and is wondering why you’re not just running him on your team to begin with.

      <p class="question">
        For Omega Supreme, it says once your opponent shuffles their deck you combine. If I swing with one of Omega's pieces, but mid-attack my opponent shuffles their deck, do I combine and stop my attack because the character who triggered the attack isn't and my opponent has another character untapped? Along the same lines, when someone attacks into an Omega Supreme piece and they shuffle their deck. When you go to combine, does the attack still go through to the now combined Omega Supreme? Or does the attack get canceled as the original target isn't on the field anymore?
        <span><a href="#Rules_Roundup-2019-11-08__9-18"><img src="/images/permalink.svg"/></a></span>
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        If a character attacks or defends, and in the middle of the attack, combines into another character, the new combined character continues to attack or defend. Note that the combined character is untapped and will remain untapped for the duration of the attack.

        If I have a Cassette in Bot Mode that is chosen as a defender but flip a Swerve does it fizzle the attack when the character flips to Cassette due to the Stealth on that side as long as another target is legal to attack? Or not, since it's already been chosen as the defender?

        If I flip a character who lets me play a card for free such as Detritus - Arms Dealer who allows me to play a Black Pip card, can I play a Smoke Cloak this way to give Detritus Tough 1 for that battle, or does it apply after flips have ready happened?

      <p class="question">
        I play Brainstorm, then Ancient Wisdom and System Reboot. My new hand is Multi-Mission Gear, Brainstorm, and 2 Unleashed Potential. Can I play Mutli-Mission Gear, then Brainstorm, and then both Unleashed Potentials?
        <span><a href="#Rules_Roundup-2019-11-08__9-24"><img src="/images/permalink.svg"/></a></span>
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        Let’s walk through this whole play. You play Brainstorm and your first action is Ancient Wisdom. Ancient Wisdom has you scrap the top two cards of your deck and put an Action and/or Upgrade from among the scrapped cards into your hand. At this point, you can play Unleash Potential, if it’s in your hand.<br/>Let’s say you do. You get a card with 1 star from outside the game and put it into your hand. This may not be a great idea, because you then play the second action from Brainstorm, which is System Reboot. You scrap your hand (including that fancy star card you just snagged) and draw 4 cards.<br/>But instead, let’s say you don’t play Unleash Potential. That brings you to the end of Ancient Wisdom and now you System Reboot just as above.<br/>In either case, your new hand is Multi-Mission Gear, Brainstorm, and 2 Unleash Potentials. You’ve already played an Action this turn, so we’re guessing you’ll now play Multi-Mission Gear. This allows you to play an Action such as Brainstorm. Brainstorm will allow you to play 2 Unleash Potentials. You played Ancient Wisdom earlier in your turn, so you can get two 1-star cards from outside the game.
