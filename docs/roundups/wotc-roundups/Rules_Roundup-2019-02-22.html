        Jetfire’s wording of “put” is different than “play”, which does circumvent the restrictions on cards like Superior Jetpack and Superior Plating.

        Is this the correct order of operations for Silverbolt? He starts in alt mode and attacks. He flips all his cards, using his Bold 1. After he flips all his cards, he meets the prerequisites for his alt mode ability. He flips to bot mode, deals 1 damage to an enemy, then calculates his attack with his bot mode, then the target makes their flips and calculates defense, then damage is dealt and battle ends.

        So, with Leap of Faith: it says to scrap a card, which you may play, then scrap another card, and you may play that. For actions, it's a no brainer. But for upgrades, if you play it from your scrap, does it stay on the battlefield?

      <div class="answer">
        Yes. You’ll play the upgrade just as you would from your hand and it will remain attached to the character as normal.

        Say Dirge (In bot mode) gets the effect of Steamroll, and then KOs a character, but does too much damage and ends up with 3 damage left over. Following Steamroll's effect, that 3 damage gets moved to a different character, but the damage spillover target has only 3 health left, and the second character is KO'd. The first KO obviously doesn't trigger Dirge's bot mode skill, but would that second KO cause Dirge's skill to kick in untap him?

      <div class="answer">
        When you move the damage via Steamroll, it ceases to be attack damage and therefore doesn’t trigger Dirge’s bot mode ability.

        Okay, so you've stated in the past that your opponent's characters count as "cards" when referring to Motormaster rulings. I was wondering, with regards to Spare Parts (which scraps itself instead of another Upgrade attached to your character) and Force Field, would a character attack count as a card causing Force Field to discard? In other words, if your opponent attacked an upgraded character with both a Spare Parts and a Force Field with enough damage to trigger the Force Field's effect, would you scrap the Force Field or the Spare Parts?

        You would scrap Force Field because its ability is what causes it to be scrapped, not your opponent’s attack.

        Say I have 2 copies of Universal Network Access (Or any star card) in my deck, and I use Unleash Potential to bring a third copy into my hand. Fast forward a bit, and I manage to play Unleash Potential again. Could I use that to bring a fourth copy of that card into the game or does the rule of three still apply?
