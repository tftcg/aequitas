        Similar to Treasure Hunt, scrap the cards you have remaining according to instructions, shuffle all the other cards in your Scrap Pile (not including the ones you just scrapped) into your deck, then scrap any remaining cards from your deck, for a total of three.

      <div class="answer">
        Cards are put under a character face-up unless otherwise specified. If cards are put under a character face-down (such as with Skytread, Sky-Byte, or Perceptor), they are put in a random order so that players do not know which card is which. Once a face-down card is put under a character, players are not permitted to look at them.

        When a character defends equipped with the Crossguard 2X, how much is pierce reduced by? For example's sake, let's say the character has 3 base defense.

      <div class="answer">
        Crossguard looks at the defender's total defense after the attacker flips (i.e. before the defender flips battle cards). So a base defense of 3, plus the +2 from Crossguard, means that it reduces Pierce by 5, assuming no other effects.

        The column under the station symbol first identifies the station condition in the first box, and then any station bonuses. The condition is the requirements for a character to be able to take that station. Typiclaly it is a number and the phrase Bot. The number, if present, identifies that a character trying to take that station must have a star cost less than or equal to that number. Bot indicates that the character must be in Bot mode. The rest of the column provides any station bonuses that apply to a character when they have taken this station.

        If a character dies mid-attack whether it be to Electrified Spikes or something else, can either player still swap for green icons?

      <div class="answer">
        As long as cards were flipped during battle, you can swap cards for green battle icon cards. If a character dies before battle cards are flipped, then you would not be able to swap for green battle icon cards.

        When you change your characters. You present your starting team (including stratagems) before swapping battle cards.

        I have Major Ultra Magnus on the field with the stratagems Stuck On You (allowing 2 armor slots as I have started with only 2 characters), Impervious (Ultra Magnus stratagem), and I have ultra Magnus armor and a Reflex Circuits on my Ultra Magnus. My opponent plays Vandalize and calls the Armor type. What happens?

      <div class="answer">
        Each armor on Ultra Magnus triggers Impervious, allowing you to instead scrap an armor from your hand. To keep both armors, you would need to scrap two armors.

        Greasestain is tapped in alt mode, and Rum-Maj is in bot mode with Sidecar Artillery in her weapon slot. I attack with Rum-Maj, adding her to Greasestain's station. Does the Sidecar Artillery trigger?

      <div class="answer">
        No. The attack order with stations is to declare attacker, declare defender, take attacker station, take defender station, and only then to do attack triggers. Greasestain's station has increased Rum-Maj's attack to 4, missing the Sidecar Artillery trigger.

        When can I stop an attacking character's ability from triggering by removing a necessary flipped battle card?

      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        When the ability reads similar to "When this attacks and flips [Card-Condition]", removing the right card would permit you to block the attackers ability. That is because this language reviews the cards flipped after they have all been flipped, including the two extra for a white icon. For example Metroplex's bot mode ability. However when it reads "When you flip [Single-Card-Condition] while this is attacking", the ability would trigger before you had the opportunity to remove the card. This is because this language triggers on a single card flip event. An example is Starscream - Decepticon King flipping a Decepticon Crown.

        Junkheap's bot mode says "When this defends and your opponent flips battle cards", allowing its owner to scrap one of the battle cards flipped. What if the attacker attacks with Anticipation Engine and plays Swarm! from the top of their deck; can the defending Junkheap player scrap one of those cards?

        Yes, they can choose to scrap one of the flipped Swarm! cards because it is happening within the battle while Junkheap is defending.
