        Most KO'd characters are moved to the KO area (see <a href="/keywords/battle-master.html">Battle Master</a> and <a href="/keywords/weaponizer.html">Weaponizer</a> for notable exceptons). <br/>The KO area is usually off to the side of the main battlefield, out of the way of the play but still visible. Note that characters may still be flipped as a part of your flip action, however they cannot be flipped by battle cards unless a card specifically states it can.

        Your deck has two types of card in it, cards which are placed on the table at the start of the game and cards that are placed in a face-down stack. The Battle Cards are the cards that are placed in the face-down stack. To date they will say either Action or Upgrade on them on the middle left of the deck, and they are all the same size. They all have the same grey/white/red background image.

        Characters belong to a Faction. Currently each Transformer can only belong to one Faction, though there are characters in the Transformer storylines who were double-agents and so that may change. There are currently (Wave 5) three factions in the game, Autobots, Decepticons and Mercenaries.

      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        Yes, Focus stacks. Per the 2.0 Rules; Focus is a single action, so if a character has multiple instances of focus, add the numbers together to determine how many cards to look at. For example, if a character has Focus 1 and is upgraded with a utility that gives it another instance of Focus 1, look at the top two cards of your deck before flipping battle cards. You may scrap any number of them and put the rest back on top of your deck in any order.

      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        This is a term introduced in Wave 5's explanatory text, for example on Hull Down. It refers to the effect flipped battle icons provide to the total attack or defense of the battling characters. For example, when flipping Hull Down on an attack, only a character with the Tank trait on its current mode would receive the battle effect of +1 Attack from Hull Down's battle icon. Note that an orange battle icon was still flipped, so any abilities that depend on the color of flipped battle icons would still have seen an orange battle icon.
