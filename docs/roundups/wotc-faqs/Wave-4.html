      <div class="answer">
        There are two parts to a Bounty ability: a trigger condition that tells you to “use this card’s Bounty ability” and the Bounty ability itself that gives you a reward. In this set, all the conditions are the same: when the character does enough attack damage to KO an enemy. The rewards are different on each card.

        Yes. Safeguard works as long as the character is currently undamaged, even if it was previously damaged in the game. If you repair that damage, Safeguard can cushion another blow.

        A Revenge ability is a triggered ability that triggers when the character with the ability is KO’d. There aren’t that many of them. They’re a Decepticon thing. The Decepticons must be up to something.

      <div class="answer">
        Battle Masters and Weaponizers are characters that start in bot mode and can be played in their Upgrade mode after they are KO’d. They don’t have alt modes and can’t flip while they are on the battlefield.<br/>In Siege 2 (Wave 4), there are two Weaponizers, each made up of two cards. They start assembled together in bot mode. When one of these Weaponizers is KO’d, it splits into two different Upgrades that you can then play. These Upgrades can be played on separate characters or onto the same character.<br/>After a Battle Master or Weaponizer Upgrade would leave the battlefield, it’s put into your KO area instead.

        The combine abilities don’t work from the KO area, so in that case your Base would be left standing alone. Unless you have a way to bring the Spaceship or the Tank back onto the battlefield, you won’t be able to combine them into Captain Omega Supreme. Good luck!

        The cards under Raider Skytread are basically out of play for a while. They’re not considered on the battlefield, even if that’s where they are physically, so none of their abilities apply. If one of those cards is an Upgrade, that Upgrade isn’t on Raider Skytread, and so on. They’re also not in your scrap pile, so they won’t be shuffled into your deck when it’s empty. They can return to your hand using Raider Skytread’s last ability.

        In that case you’ll reveal as many cards as you can from your deck, then—leaving those cards aside—shuffle your scrap pile to rebuild your deck. Then reveal more cards so a total of 5 are revealed. The revealed cards that aren’t Upgrades will be only cards in your scrap pile when you’re done.

        In that case, your opponent scraps all the cards in their deck. Then, setting those cards aside, they shuffle all the other cards in their scrap pile into their deck. Then they scrap enough cards from their reformed deck to scrap the total number of cards they were supposed to. In most cases, however many cards they were supposed to scrap will be the number of cards in their scrap pile after Megatron’s ability is finished. Sorry, after Lord Megatron’s ability is finished.

        In that case, scrap all the cards in their deck. Then, setting those cards aside, shuffle all the other cards in your scrap pile into your deck. Then scrap enough cards from your reformed deck to scrap a total of 4 cards. The cards that aren’t Upgrades will be only cards in your scrap pile when you’re done.

        That ability doesn’t directly modify how much attack damage is being done to the character (note it doesn’t use “instead”), so it waits for effects like Blast Suit to apply, then sees if the character is taking more than 5 attack damage. If it is, the character takes 5 attack damage.

        The card under Sergeant Barricade is basically out of play for a bit (at least, until you play it using the alt ode ability). While the card is under Sergeant Barricade, it’s not considered on the battlefield, even if that’s where it is physically, so none of its abilities apply. If the card is an Upgrade, that Upgrade isn’t on Sergeant Barricade, and so on. It’s also not in your scrap pile, so it won’t be shuffled into your deck when it’s empty.

        Changing a character’s base attack is just like changing the number that’s printed on the card. From there, all other bonuses apply as normal. For example, if you have a Truck with 3 attack upgraded with Indestructible Sword (that gives it +2 attack), its attack will be 9 (7 from 4-Wheel Drive +2 from the upgrade). If it stops being a Truck that turn, its attack will be 5 (base 3 attack +2 from the upgrade).

        If there are multiple abilities trying to modify how much attack damage the upgraded character would take, the controller of that character decides what order to apply them in. In this example, you could choose either of the following:<br/>    Reveal Heroic Resolve first. Instead of taking 3 attack damage, your character is now taking 1 attack damage (enough to drop it to 1 health). Now Blast Suit applies, and the 1 attack damage becomes 0 attack damage, which is half of 1 rounded down. Your character ends up taking no attack damage and Blast Suit is scrapped.<br/>    Apply Blast Suit first. Instead of taking 3 attack damage, your character now is taking 1 attack damage, which is half of 3 rounded down. This isn’t enough attack damage to KO your character, so Heroic Resolve stays face down.

        It will have 1 attack. Although a character’s attack can’t go below 0, the -1 applies again once your character’s attack is raised.

        No. The +3 attack bonus applies as long as the character is attacking and in alt mode. As soon as one of those isn’t true, the bonus stops applying. However, if the character returns to alt mode while it’s still attacking, the bonus would apply again.

        Assuming they drew a card at the start of their turn, you would reveal Hijack. Then instead them drawing two cards, you’d draw two cards. Hijack’s effect lasts for the rest of the turn, so if they tried to draw more cards, you’d draw them again.

        Lucky Vest doesn’t directly modify how much attack damage is being done to the character (note it doesn’t use “instead”), so it waits for effects like Blast Suit to apply, then sees if the character is taking more than 4 attack damage. If it is, the character takes 4 attack damage.
