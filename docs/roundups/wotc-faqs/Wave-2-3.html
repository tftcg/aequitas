        What are Combiners?

      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        It would be hard to have a set called Rise of the Combiners without… the Combiners!<br/>Combiners are teams of characters that join in a third mode called Combiner mode. Most teams have a corresponding battle card called an Enigma that combines the team under the right circumstances. One Combiner in this set (Dreadwing - Sky Destroyer) has a different way of combining.<br/>When a character is combined, it starts untapped and it gets all the damage counters from the characters that formed it. It can keep upgrades from those characters based on its upgrade slots. Unless the Combiner says differently, it will have 1 Weapon slot, 1 Utility slot, and 1 Armor slot like most characters. If there are too many Upgrades to fit into a slot, you can keep as many as you can fit, and the rest are scrapped.<br/>A character in Combiner mode is a single character, even though it’s made up of multiple cards.  When it attacks, the whole thing becomes tapped. If it’s KO’d (and somehow you haven’t lost the game), it stays in Combiner mode in the KO area.<br/>A character in Combiner mode can’t flip. Ignore any instruction to flip it. Also, a character in Combiner mode can’t “break apart” into its individual cards.

        No. You always follow the instructions on the card in order. If you don’t already have the specified Combiner on the battlefield, the first ability won’t do anything.

        Triple Changers are characters with three modes: bot mode and two alt modes (labeled 1 and<br/>2). They start in alt mode 1. When a Triple Changer flips, it can flip to either of the two other<br/>modes.

        This set introduces a new battle icon: green! Here’s how it works. After a battle in which you<br/>flipped at least one card with a green battle icon, you may swap a card in your hand with one of<br/>the cards you flipped with a green battle icon. The card you swap from your hand will be<br/>scrapped at the end of the turn, along with all the other cards you played or flipped during the<br/>turn.

        No, and in fact you can’t even if you want to. Brave doesn’t override the rules for attacking<br/>tapped/untapped characters. If your opponent has any tapped characters you must attack one<br/>of them. If a tapped character had brave, you would have to attack that one if you could.

        Stealth doesn’t override the rules for attacking tapped/untapped characters. Since the<br/>tapped character is the only one that can be attacked, that’s where your attack is headed.

        Brave and stealth essentially cancel each other out. You must attack that character if able,<br/>and you must attack other characters if able. This basically means you must attack a character<br/>you can attack, the same as if those abilities weren’t there.

        You can use one tap ability during your turn, before you attack. It’s one of your turn actions,<br/>just like playing an Action card, playing an Upgrade card, or flipping one of your characters to its<br/>other mode. To use the tap ability, the character that has the ability must be untapped. Using<br/>the ability causes the character to become tapped.

      <div class="answer">
        Secret Actions are a new kind of Action card, keeping your opponent in the dark until it’s too<br/>late for them to stop you. To play a Secret Action, put it into the played area (where actions and<br/>flipped battle cards normally go) face down. Secret Actions don’t have an immediate effect, but<br/>wait until later in the game to do their thing, often on your opponent’s turn!<br/>Each Secret Action has two parts. First, a Reveal condition. This tells you when to reveal the<br/>Secret Action by turning it face up. Most Reveal conditions are things your opponent does, like<br/>attack one of your characters or play certain kinds of cards.<br/>Second, a When Revealed effect. This tells you what the Secret Action does when it’s finally<br/>revealed. After a Secret Action is revealed this way, it stays in the played area and will be<br/>scrapped at the end of the turn.<br/>One warning though: Secret Actions won’t wait around forever. If a Secret Action is played<br/>during your turn, it will wait until the end of your opponent’s next turn. If its Reveal condition<br/>isn’t met by then, it will be scrapped along with all the other played or flipped cards from that<br/>turn. It’s scrapped face up, and scrapping it this way won’t cause its When Revealed effect to<br/>happen.

        There’s a new battle icon on some battle cards in War for Cybertron: Siege I. It’s black! What<br/>does it mean? If you’re on the attack, hopefully good things for you.<br/>For each black battle icon you flip while attacking, your character gets pierce 1 until end of turn.<br/>Remember that pierce numbers add up, so flipping two black icons in an attack will give your<br/>attacker pierce 2, and so on.

        You use it before the game begins. After you put the Medic! into your hand, you’ll shuffle the rest of your deck. Then you’ll draw the normal 3 cards at the start of the game.
