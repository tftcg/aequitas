        How many stratagems can I play?
        <span><a href="#Wave-5__1"><img src="/images/permalink.svg"/></a></span>
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        You can play up to one stratagem for each different character, trait, or faction listed on the stratagem, as long as your starting team includes that character, trait, or faction. For example, if your starting team is all Autobots and includes Optimus Prime - Legendary Warrior, you can play both Heroic Spotlight and Duty & Honor.

      <div class="answer">
        Stratagems go on the battlefield. At the beginning of the game, as you reveal your team, you also reveal your stratagems.

        Some stratagems have an ability that causes them to flip. What does that mean?
        <span><a href="#Wave-5__3"><img src="/images/permalink.svg"/></a></span>
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        Flipping a stratagem essentially turns its ability off. This happens on one-time abilities to remind you that you've already used them.

        What are Head & Body modes?
        <span><a href="#Wave-5__6"><img src="/images/permalink.svg"/></a></span>
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        Titan Masters Attack introduces two new character modes that work together: head mode and body mode.<br/>                Cards with a head mode are placed above a character that has a body mode, combining them into a single character. The resulting character is a single character made up of both cards. The body mode card will tell you the character's stats and abilities, and the head mode card will give the character a bonus. That bonus may be an added ability or an increase to attack, defense, or health. Like other characters, that character starts the game in alt mode. If the character is KO'd, even if it's your last character card, the card with head mode is returned to the battlefield in bot mode. That bot mode character can't flip.

      <div class="question">

        The character card with head mode and the one with body mode each have stars. Do those stars all count toward my deck limit?
        <span><a href="#Wave-5__7"><img src="/images/permalink.svg"/></a></span>
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        Yes. Each card's stars count toward the 25-star limit. During the game, the character has all the stars from its two cards.

        What happens if the character flips?
        <span><a href="#Wave-5__8"><img src="/images/permalink.svg"/></a></span>
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        The body mode card can flip back and forth, from alt mode to body mode. The head mode card doesn't flip, so its bonus always applies, no matter which mode the character is in.

      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        Yes. They're completely mix-and-match. You could even put an Autobot head onto a Decepticon body, or vice versa.

        If I have a head from one faction on a body from a different faction, which faction is the resulting character.
        <span><a href="#Wave-5__10"><img src="/images/permalink.svg"/></a></span>
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        Both. The character is both an Autobot and a Decepticon.

        If I have a character that's both an Autobot and a Decepticon, does my starting team have "only Autobots"?
        <span><a href="#Wave-5__11"><img src="/images/permalink.svg"/></a></span>
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        No. In order to qualify as "only Autobots," your starting deck can't have any characters that are another faction (even if they're also Autobots).

      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        You can but note that each card is a separate character card. This means you could have a character card with a head mode or one with a body mode in your sideboard, but not both.

      <div class="question">
        <a name="Wave-5__13"></a>
        What are Hybrid Battle Icons?
        <span><a href="#Wave-5__13"><img src="/images/permalink.svg"/></a></span>
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        Some battle cards in this set have a new style of battle icons: hybrids. These battle icons have a both a color and the symbol of a trait. For example, the battle card Nitro Booster has a black Car battle icon. Hybrid battle icons always count as their color, except if they're flipped in battle for a character that doesn't match their trait, that battle icon will have no effect that battle.
      </div>

    <li id="Wave 5 FAQ__14" class="faq_entry">
      <div class="question">
        <a name="Wave-5__14"></a>
        If an effect refers to the battle icons you've flipped, can that effect see a hybrid icon if the character doesn't match its trait?
        <span><a href="#Wave-5__14"><img src="/images/permalink.svg"/></a></span>
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        Yes. For example, Mindwipe - Hypnotist (body mode) is a melee character that has an ability that triggers "when this attacks and flip at least one black battle icon." If Mindwipe attacks and you flip Master of Metallikato (a battle card with a black ranged battle icon), Mindwipe's ability will trigger, even though the black battle icon will have no effect.

        Can Fortress Maximus have a different head than Cerebros?
        <span><a href="#Wave-5__15"><img src="/images/permalink.svg"/></a></span>
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        No. Fortress Maximus is just like other character cards with a body, except it's bigger, and it must have Cerebros as its head. Cerebros is unique in that it has both a head mode and a body mode. So it starts the game attached to Fortress Maximus, but you also get another head to put onto Cerebros. This can be Emissary or any other character with a head mode.<br/>        The stars from all three cards count toward the 25-star limit. Note that Fortress Maximus, Cerebros, and Emissary have 25 stars combined.
      </div>

    <li id="Wave 5 FAQ__16" class="faq_entry">
      <div class="question">
        <a name="Wave-5__16"></a>
        Does Fortress Maximus get the bonus from Cerebros' Head?
        <span><a href="#Wave-5__16"><img src="/images/permalink.svg"/></a></span>
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        While Fortress Maximus is on the battlefield, it gets the Bold 1, Tough 1 bonus from Cerebros, but it doesn't get the bonus from the other head attached to Cerebros. That head's bonus will apply to Cerebros after it's deployed.

    <li id="Wave 5 FAQ__17" class="faq_entry">
      <div class="question">
        <a name="Wave-5__17"></a>
        What do you do when Fortress Maximus is KO'd?
        <span><a href="#Wave-5__17"><img src="/images/permalink.svg"/></a></span>
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        If Fortress Maximus is KO'd, you put Cerebros back onto the battlefield in body mode, with its head still attached. Because a character can't flip into head mode, Cerebros won't be able to flip while it's on the battlefield. If Cerebros is KO'd, you put its head onto the battlefield in bot mode.

        How does Autobot Whirl's ability to interact with other effects that modify the amount of attack damage a character can take?
        <span><a href="#Wave-5__21"><img src="/images/permalink.svg"/></a></span>
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        That ability doesn't directly modify how much attack damage is being done to Autobot Whirl (note it doesn't use "instead"), so it waits for other effects (like Blast Suit) to apply, then sees if Autobot Whirl is taking more than 5 attack damage from a Ranged character's attack. If it is, Autobot Whirl takes 5 attack damage.

        The cards under Wingspan are basically out of play and are used to count the bonus for Wingspan's alt mode ability. They're not considered on the battlefield, even if that's where they are physically, so none of their abilities apply. Those Upgrades aren't on Wingspan, and so on. They're also not in your scrap pile, so they won't be shuffled into your deck when it's empty.
