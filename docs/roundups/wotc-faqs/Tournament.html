      <div class="answer">
        A Transformers TCG match consists of a series of games that are played until one player has won two games. Drawn games do not count toward this goal. If the round ends before a player has won two games, the winner of the match is the player who has won the most games at that point. If both players have equal game wins, the match is a draw.

        The player whose turn it is finishes their turn (including untapping all characters at the end<br/>              of the turn if all characters are tapped at this point). Play then continues as normal until a player <br/>              wins the game or all characters are tapped at the end of a turn. If the game is incomplete at the end <br/>              of the additional time, resolve Tiebreak procedures.

      <div class="answer">
        If a game or match is not completed, players may concede or mutually agree to a draw in that game or match. A match is considered complete once the result slip is filled out or, if match slips are not being used, a player leaves the table after game play is finished.<br/>              Players may not agree to a concession or draw in exchange for any reward or incentive. Doing so will be considered Bribery (see section 5.2).<br/>              If a player refuses to play, it is assumed that they have conceded the match.

      <div class="answer">
        At the end of the additional time, if the players have won an equal number of games, each player counts the amount of health remaining on their characters on the battlefield. The player with the higher remaining health wins the match. <br/>              <br/>              If the remaining health is tied, each player counts the total number of stars of their characters on the battlefield. The player with the higher total stars wins the match. <br/>              <br/>              If the total stars are tied, each player flips the top two cards of their deck. The player who flips the most white battle icons wins. If still tied, players repeat flipping two cards from the top of their deck until the tie is broken. If a player’s deck needs to be shuffled, that player shuffles cards from their scrap pile and any cards flipped during the tiebreaker procedure. <br/>              <br/>              If the tiebreaker procedure can’t break the tie (for example, if all cards in all decks have exactly one white battle icon), flip a coin to determine the winner.

        Hidden information refers to information a player isn’t allowed access to, such as the faces of cards in an opponent’s hand.<br/>Throughout the match and pregame procedures, players are responsible for keeping their cards above the level of the playing surface and for making reasonable efforts to prevent hidden information from being revealed.<br/>However, players may choose to reveal their hands or any other hidden information available only to them, unless specifically prohibited by the rules. Players must not actively attempt to gain information hidden from them.
