        You can’t have more than one of the same character card on your team, but you can have more than one of the same character if they’re on different cards. For example, your team can’t have two copies Bumblebee, Brave Warrior, but it could have one Bumblebee, Brave Warrior and one Bumblebee, Courageous Scout.

      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        Pierce tells you the minimum amount of damage a character can do in an attack, although a character can never do more damage than its attack total. For example, say a character with Pierce 2 attacks.  After flipping battle cards, the attack total is 5 and the defense total is 4. Normally, the character with Pierce would do only 1 damage, but because of Pierce, it does 2 damage instead.  This also works if the attack total is equal to or less than the defense total. Say the attacker has an attack total of 5, but this time it runs into a massive defense total of 9. If that character had Pierce 2, it would still do 2 damage.  If the character with Pierce 2 had an attack total of only 1, it would do 1 damage against any defense total.

      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        Yes. For example, say a character with Pierce 4 attacks Insecticon Skrapnel in bot mode. (He has the ability "This can't take more than 3 attack damage from a single attack.") After battle cards are flipped, the attacking character would do 2 damage, but Pierce raises that to 4. Insecticon Skrapnel’s ability would then reduce the damage done to 3.

      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        These abilities describe what kind of character the Upgrade can be put on. This is usually a trait such<br/>as Melee, Plane, or Insecticon. An Upgrade can be put on a character only if that character matches the<br/>listed requirement.

        <span><a href="#Wave-1__11"><img src="/images/permalink.svg"/></a></span>
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        The Upgrade stays with the character it’s on. That ability limits only what the Upgrade can initially be<br/>put on. Once that happens, the Upgrade doesn’t check again.

      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        A KO’d character has damage counters on it equal to its health. Note that this is true even if it took<br/>more damage while on the battlefield. For example, if a character with 7 health takes 10 damage, it ends<br/>up in the KO area with 7 damage counters.

      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        A triggered ability is an ability that’s caused by a specified game action. They’re usually written in the<br/>form "When [something happens] -> [effect]." The effect happens just after the specified game action is<br/>taken. For example, many characters have triggered abilities that start with "When you flip to this<br/>mode." The effects of these abilities happen immediately after you flip the character to the appropriate<br/>mode.

      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        Triggered abilities always happen one at a time. If all the triggered abilities belong to one player, that<br/>player chooses their order. If both players have triggered abilities that would happen at the same time,<br/>first the player whose turn it is handles all their triggered abilities in any order, then the other player<br/>does the same with their triggered abilities.

      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        In that case, Arcee will have Pierce equal to her attack plus the Pierce from the Upgrade. In that example, Arcee’s attack is 1, so she’ll have Pierce 4. However, remember that characters with Pierce <br/>can’t deal more damage than their attack total, so she’ll do only 1 damage (not including other attack bonuses or orange battle icons).
